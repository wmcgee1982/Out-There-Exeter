                        A living exploration of undoing and redoing queer single parenting and love, in conversation 
                        with an AI algorithm and a toddler. As Hannah Silva navigates friendship, dating and life as 
                        a queer single parent in London, their toddler and the algorithm contribute humour, play and 
                        insight. With the help/disruption of these unreliable narrators, Hannah deconstructs their 
                        story, and constructs a new one. They unravel everything they have been taught to want, 
                        finding alternative ways of thinking, loving and parenting today. Queer, creative, sexy and 
                        compassionate, My Child, the Algorithm is non-fiction at its finest.
