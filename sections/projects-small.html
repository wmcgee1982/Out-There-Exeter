              <p class="project-description-small">A project presented by Out There Exeter in collaboration with the Iris Prize and Exeter Phoenix, showcasing standout films from Iris 2024 that explored love, identity, and the human experience. Sister Wives (15) told the story of two sister wives married to the same man who began to develop feelings for each other, winning the 2024 Iris Prize Best British & Co-op Audience Award. JIA (12A) followed a grieving Chinese mother on a road trip in Australia to remember her late son, where her conservative values were tested when she learned her son’s lover was Eric, winning the 2024 Youth Jury Award. Blood Like Water (15) saw Shadi embark on a secret adventure that forced his family into a difficult decision: collaborate with the Israeli occupation or face humiliation by their own people, winning the 2024 Iris Prize. The Iris Prize is a film and media organisation dedicated to showcasing and promoting LGBTQ+ stories, expanding their reach and impact.</p>
