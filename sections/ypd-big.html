            <h4>About the Event</h4>
            <p>Following the success of last year’s Young Person’s Day at Out There Queer Fest 2024, 
                Out There and Exeter Library brings back Young Person’s Day for 2026!

            <p><b>Rising Icons – <i>Unleash the creative hero within</i></b></p>
            <p>A world where creativity has power and everyone has a hero inside waiting to be unleashed. 
                This is a day for you and your friends to level up: to try new things, meet new friends, and be part of a supported community.</p>
            <p>It’s FREE. It’s for you and your tribe. It’s where icons are made. And, snacks and refreshments will be provided</p>
