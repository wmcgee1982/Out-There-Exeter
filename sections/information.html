        <h3>Out There Exeter</h3>
        <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for celebration and inclusivity. We ignite networks, strengthen connections, and celebration inclusivity within our vibrant LGBTQIA+ community. 
            We are reimagining Exeter's queer landscape by empowering voices to come forward and tell their stroies.</p>
        <p>Out There Exeter are dedicated to uplifting and celebrating the LGBTQIA+ community in Exeter through <span>arts, culture, sports and advocacy</span>. 
            Exeter Queer Fest, a 10-day queer fringe-style festival (September 27th - October 6th 2024), bridges the gap between artists, communities, netowrks, and individuals within the LGBTQIA+ sphere.</p>

        <h3>Exeter Queer Fest</h3>
        <p>Get ready to celebrate all things queer. Out There Exeter are excited to deliver a festival of queer culture, an explosion of creative arts, sporting trimphs, advocacy and pure joy for LGBTQIA+ people and friends.</p>
        <p>We envision Exeter Queer Fest as an annual national event, making Exeter a cultural hub akin to Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>
        <p>We want to introduce a varied and wide-reaching programme, strategically centring the inaugural festival on the LGBTQIA+ community, building on Exeter's strong queer community, society groups, and arts scene.
            This year's festival and events are supported by Exeter Phoenix, Exeter Northcott Theatre, Barnfield Theatre, Royal Albert Memorial Museum, and Exeter Library.</p>

        <p>Out There Exeter recognise the significance of queer culture to the LGBTQIA+ community. Exeter Queer Fest exists to celebrate queer culture and to challenge the status quo by making queer culture more accessible and equitable.</p>
        <p>Queer culture encompasses the diverse and vibrant experiences of LGBTQIA+ individuals. It's a tapestry woven from threads of self-expression, creativity, community, activism, and resilience.</p>
