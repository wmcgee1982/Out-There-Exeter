        <h3>Out There Exeter</h3>
        <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for getting <i>out there</i> and celebrating inclusivity and queer culture. We ignite networks, strengthen connections, and celebrate inclusivity within our vibrant LGBTQIA+ community. 
            We are reimagining Exeter's queer landscape by empowering voices <i>out there</i>, to come forward and tell their stories.</p>
