      <h3>About Out There Exeter</h3>
      <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for getting out there
         and celebrating inclusivity and queer culture. We ignite networks,
         strengthen connections, and celebrate inclusivity within our vibrant
         LGBTQIA+ community. We are reimagining Exeter's queer
         landscape by empowering voices out there, to come forward and
         tell their stories.

      <h3>Out There Queer Fest</h3>
      <p>In September 2024, Out There Exeter was excited to deliver a 17-day festival of queer culture,
         an explosion of creative arts, community groups, and advocacy for
         LGBTQIA+ people and friends. We envision Out There Queer
         Fest as an annual national event, making Exeter a cultural hub.
      </p>
      <p>Out There Queer Fest, fostered a spirit of inclusion and empowerment,
         which took place from 23rd September to 6th October 2024. 
         We delivered a dynamic programme of 40+ events featuring creative expression
         through artistic performances, cultural events, and community
         activities. The festival brought together national and local emerging talents. It amplified queer voices, 
         highlighted advocacy efforts, and provided a platform to champion equality and challenge discrimination.
