        <h3>About Out There Exeter</h3>
        <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for getting out there
            and celebrating inclusivity and queer culture. We ignite networks,
            strengthen connections, and celebrate inclusivity within our vibrant
            LGBTQIA+ community. We are reimagining Exeter's queer
            landscape by empowering voices out there, to come forward and
            tell their stories.
