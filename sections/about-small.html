        <h3>About Out There Exeter</h3>
        <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for getting <i>out there</i> and celebrating inclusivity and queer culture. We ignite networks, strengthen connections, and celebrate inclusivity within our vibrant LGBTQIA+ community. 
            We are reimagining Exeter's queer landscape by empowering voices, <i>out there</i>, to come forward and tell their stories.</p>

        <h3>Out There Queer Fest</h3>
        <p>Get ready to celebrate all things queer. Out There Exeter are excited to deliver a festival of queer culture, an explosion of creative arts, sporting trimphs, advocacy and pure joy for LGBTQIA+ people and friends.</p>
        <p>We envision Out There Queer Fest as an annual national event, making Exeter a cultural hub akin to Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>
        <p>We want to introduce a varied and wide-reaching programme, strategically centring the inaugural festival on the LGBTQIA+ community, building on Exeter's strong queer community, society groups, and arts scene.
            This year's festival and events are supported by core Exeter venues: Exeter Phoenix, Exeter Northcott Theatre, Barnfield Theatre, Royal Albert Memorial Museum, and Exeter Library.</p>
            </br>
        <h3>Queer Culture</h3>
        <p>Out There Exeter recognise the significance of queer culture to the LGBTQIA+ community <i>out there</i>. Out There Queer Fest exists to celebrate queer culture and to challenge the status quo by making queer culture more accessible and equitable.</p>
        <p>Queer culture encompasses the diverse and vibrant experiences of LGBTQIA+ individuals. It's a tapestry woven from threads of self-expression, creativity, community, activism, and resilience.</p>
