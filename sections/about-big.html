                <h3>About Out There Exeter</h3>
                <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for getting out there
                    and celebrating inclusivity and queer culture. We ignite networks,
                    strengthen connections, and celebrate inclusivity within our vibrant
                    LGBTQIA+ community. We are reimagining Exeter's queer
                    landscape by empowering voices out there, to come forward and
                    tell their stories.
                </p>

        <h2>Out There Queer Fest</h2>
        <p>In September 2024, Out There Exeter was excited to deliver a 17-day festival of queer culture,
            an explosion of creative arts, community groups, and advocacy for
            LGBTQIA+ people and friends. We envision Out There Queer
            Fest as an annual national event, making Exeter a cultural hub.

        <p>Out There Queer Fest, fostered a spirit of inclusion and empowerment,
           which took place from 23rd September to 6th October 2024. 
            We delivered a dynamic programme of 40+ events featuring creative expression
            through artistic performances, cultural events, and community
            activities. The festival brought together national and local emerging talents. It amplified queer voices, 
            highlighted advocacy efforts, and provided a platform to champion equality and challenge discrimination.  
        </p></br>
        <p>
            We are proud to celebrate and build upon Exeter's vibrant queer community, 
            dynamic society groups, and thriving arts scene. This year's festival was made
             possible with the support of Exeter's flagship cultural venues: Exeter Phoenix, 
             Exeter Northcott Theatre, Barnfield Theatre, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, 
             and Exeter Library.
             We are grateful to our media partner, Radio Exe, as well as the incredible 
             support from community groups and organisations Exeter City of Literature, 
             Intercom Trust, and Exeter Pride.
             A special thank you goes to Hotel Indigo Exeter and Telstar Hotel for

        <h2>Queer Culture</h2>
        <p>Out There Exeter recognises the significance of queer culture to
            the LGBTQIA+ community. Out There Queer Fest exists to
            celebrate our culture and to challenge the status quo by making

        </p></br>
        <p>Queer culture encompasses the diverse and vibrant experiences
            of LGBTQIA+ individuals. It's a tapestry woven from threads of
            self-expression, creativity, community, activism, and resilience.
