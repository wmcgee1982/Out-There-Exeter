                <h3>About Out There Exeter</h3>
                <p>Out There Exeter was born from the desire for getting out there
                    and celebrating inclusivity and queer culture. We ignite networks,
                    strengthen connections, and celebrate inclusivity within our vibrant
                    LGBTQIA+ community. We are reimagining Exeter's queer
                    landscape by empowering voices out there, to come forward and
                    tell their stories.

        <h2>Out There Queer Fest</h2>
        <p>Out There Exeter are excited to deliver a two-week festival of queer culture,
            an explosion of creative arts, community groups, and advocacy for
            LGBTQIA+ people and friends. We envision Out There Queer
            Fest as an annual national event, making Exeter a cultural hub.
        </p></br>
        <p>Out There Queer Fest, fostering a spirit of inclusion and empowerment,
            takes place <b>23rd September to 6th October</b>. 
            Expect a dynamic programme featuring creative expression
            through artistic performances, cultural events, and community
            activities. The festival also highlights advocacy efforts, 
            providing a platform to champion equality and challenge discrimination.  
        </p></br>
        <p>We are building on Exeter's strong queer community, society groups, 
            and arts scene. This year's festival and events are supported by 
            core Exeter's flagship cultural venues: Exeter Phoenix, Exeter 
            Northcott Theatre, Barnfield Theatre, Royal Albert Memorial Museum, 
            and Exeter Library.
        </p></br>
        <h2>Queer Culture</h2>
        <p>Out There Exeter recognise the significance of queer culture to
            the LGBTQIA+ community. Out There Queer Fest exists to
            celebrate our culture and to challenge the status quo by making
            queer culture more accessible and equitable.
        </p></br>
        <p>Queer culture encompasses the diverse and vibrant experiences
            of LGBTQIA+ individuals. It's a tapestry woven from threads of
            self-expression, creativity, community, activism, and resilience.
