            <p>Our events page is a hub for queer-friendly events, venues, and community groups in Exeter.
                Out There Queer Fest provided an important space for visibility, and we're committed to offer our continued support to the community by helping people connect and celebrate queer arts and culture.
                If you're organising an event, running a venue, or leading a community group and would like our support in promoting it, drop us an email at <a href="mailto:info@out-there-exeter.com">info@out-there-exeter.com</a>. We'd be thrilled to promote it on our events page, newsletter, and socials!
