            <p><i>In association with Excel–Exeter, and in collaboration with Exeter Pride, Out There Exeter, Teignbridge Community Project, Safebreaks Devon CIC, and Sing and Sign Jukebox.</i></p>
            <p>Join us for two and half hours of activities and performances in which there is a safe and inclusive space where LGBTQ+ people with disabilities and neurodivergence can come together, be themselves, and have fun—whether that means getting involved or simply enjoying the atmosphere.</p>
            <p><a href="https://accessallaerials.yolasite.com/" target="_blank">Access All Aerials</a> will be there to capture the activities and event with photos and videos, and you might even get the chance to be interviewed for their radio show!</p>
            <p>Reach Out works to break down barriers, challenge misconceptions, and reshape outdated views by ensuring greater representation of LGBTQ+ people with learning and physical disabilities, and neurodivergence. We want to empower people with disabilities and neurodivergence to participate in social activities and share experiences.</p>
